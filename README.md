# curve_fitting

Small library of functions to fit time activity curves.

Hastily put together because of a challenge, as of now almost non-documented but made public to have something to point to.

If I submit for Phase 1 I will make proper documentation.

Mostly build around the lmfit library: https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/index.html
